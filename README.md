## About This Repository

The JavaScript is very light weight, high level, general purpose programming language. It is multi paradigm language, that is, we can use JavaScript in functional, procedural and/or Object Oriented way. 

Though it is not recommended to write data structures programs using JavaScript, I have written these programs for my personal understanding and deeper clarity about 1) Programming in Js 2) Developing data structures.

I am regularly updating this repository. The 'readline-sync' is external npm module used to take user input. 'process' module is used sometimes where it is needed to print output.
It contains following data structures:
1. LinkList
2. Tree
3. Queue
4. Stack
5. Some Sorting Algorithms
6. Pattern Matching

## recent update

Recently some C++ codes are uploaded by Nikhil Karve.

## Happy Coding ðŸ˜Š
