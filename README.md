# Data Structures & Algorithms using JavaScript/C++/Java

This repository contains computer programs related to data structures and algorithms written JavaScript/Node.js/C++.

## Installation

### Nodejs
1. Just Install Node.js in your computer. [Click Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install Node.js.
2. Clone/download folder. Open terminal and move into cloned folder.

```bash
cd data_structures
node file_name.js #to run any file in the folder.
```
### Java and C++

In case of Java check if JDK is installed on your machine. 
```
java --version
```
If not, install. 

Also Check g++ compiler is installed on your machine or not. It's inbuilt in linux/mac machines. 


## About This Repository

The JavaScript is very light weight, high level, general purpose programming language. It is multi paradigm language, that is, we can use JavaScript in functional, procedural and/or Object Oriented way. 

Though it is not recommended to write data structures programs using JavaScript, I have written these programs for my personal understanding and deeper clarity about 1) Programming in Js 2) Developing data structures.

I am regularly updating this repository. The 'readline-sync' is external npm module used to take user input. 'process' module is used sometimes where it is needed to print output.
It contains following data structures:
1. LinkList
2. Tree
3. Queue
4. Stack
5. Some Sorting Algorithms
6. Pattern Matching

## Recent Updates

C++ codes are uploaded by Nikhil Karve.
Java codes are uploaded by me.
