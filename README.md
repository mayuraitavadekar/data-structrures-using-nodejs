# Data Structures & Algorithms using JavaScript/C++/Java

This repository contains computer programs related to data structures and algorithms written JavaScript/Node.js/C++.
Please hit star button on top to make it more accessible. Go Ahead.

## Installation

### Nodejs
1. Just Install Node.js in your computer. [Click Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install Node.js.
2. Clone/download folder. Open terminal and move into cloned folder.

```bash
cd data_structures
node file_name.js #to run any file in the folder.
```
### Java and C++

In case of Java check if JDK is installed on your machine. 
```
java --version
```
If not, install. 

Also Check g++ compiler is installed on your machine or not. It's inbuilt in linux/mac machines. 

## Syllabus to be completed in DS&ALGO

### basics

- [x] asysmptotic notations and their meaining
- [x] time complexity and space complexity
- [x] recursion and significance of recursion

### data structures

- Heap
  - [x] inserting element into heap
  - [x] deleting element from heap
  - [x] creation of heap
  - [x] heap sort


## About This Repository

The JavaScript is very light weight, high level, general purpose programming language. It is multi paradigm language, that is, we can use JavaScript in functional, procedural and/or Object Oriented way. 

Though it is not recommended to write data structures programs using JavaScript, I have written these programs for my personal understanding and deeper clarity about 1) Programming in Js 2) Developing data structures.

## Recent Updates

I'm busy in working on my own startup. So not able to update the DS&ALGO codes till November 2020.

## Happy Coding ðŸ˜Š
